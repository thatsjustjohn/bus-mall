Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

As a reminder, user stories typically take the form of, "As X, I want Y, so that Z" but do not necessarily need that structure.

A wise student would take about 30-45 minutes to work on the user stories and also draft a technical plan for the project (a detailed to-do list of things to make, step by step and tested at each stage) before getting into the code. That time spent in thought and planning will make the code flow a lot faster. Give yourself a series of little problems to solve (rather an a ginormous thing that you just wade through and poke at).

As the group participant I want a functioning UI that doesn't have bugs or display issues.
As a marketing research team, I want an application thats fluid and provides good feedback but is easy for the partipant and MRT to read and use.
As a developer I want to make sure the styling and funcationality is good, images should have the same sizes and box areas on the webpage, this will ensure correct clicking results
As a developer I want to limit overexposure of images vs others.
As a marketing research team, I want to make sure that my results and requirements are defined clearly so that the developer can make sure programmatically assure none skewed results.
